SDC features flexible camera switching and no limitations on camera manufacturer or even type! Most USB cameras will work*, including most web cameras and many microscopes, endoscopes, virtual cameras (including OBS) or other specialty cameras. SDC is built to work, be free and respect the user.

SDC is being developed for use by educators and supports overlays for classroom use. Other currently available features include editable text areas, zoom, rotation, flip, freeze, full screen mode and saving images. Work is underway on basic drawing capabilities, more viewport controls (fit, fill, pan) and even a PWA implementation. 

SDC is in active development and open to feature requests and contributions!

*SDC supports [UVC ](https://www.usb.org/document-library/video-class-v15-document-set) cameras and any other video inputs that are exposed to the [MediaDevices](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaDevices)-interface.
