SDC features flexible camera switching and no limitations on camera manufacturer or even type (most USB cameras that support UVC will work, including most web cameras and many microscopes or endoscopes).

The interface currently features a movable control island, digital zoom, rotation, flip, freeze, full screen mode and hiding the interface. You can also use overlays and text fields. Saving the view as a file is under development, as are many other functions.

SDC is in active development and open to feature requests and contributions!



SDC supports [UVC ](https://www.usb.org/document-library/video-class-v15-document-set) cameras and any other video inputs that are exposed to the [MediaDevices](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaDevices)-interface (including OBS virtual cameras).
